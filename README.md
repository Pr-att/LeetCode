## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform that provides a vast collection of coding interview questions. This repository serves as a compilation of my solutions to these questions. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation, including the problem statement, approach, and implementation.

## Languages

I have implemented solutions in the following programming language:

- Python

Feel free to explore the solutions in your preferred language or suggest additional language implementations.

## Problem Categories

The problems in this repository are categorized based on their themes. Some common categories include:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- Bit Manipulation
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

You can find the problems organized within their respective categories, making it easier to navigate and locate specific problem solutions.

## File Naming Convention

To ensure clarity and organization, I have followed a consistent file naming convention. Each solution file is named using the problem's unique identifier and a brief description, separated by underscores. For example:

```
Climbing Stairs.py
Coin Change.py
House Robber.py
```

The file names are designed to be self-explanatory, allowing you to quickly identify and locate the desired problem solution.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository, whether it's providing alternative solutions, optimizing existing solutions, or adding solutions in other programming languages. If you would like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Implement the solution or make improvements to an existing one.
3. Ensure your code is well-documented, readable, and follows the established naming conventions.
4. Test your code thoroughly to ensure correctness.
5. Create a pull request, explaining the changes you have made.

Your contributions will help make this repository even more valuable as a resource for LeetCode problem-solving.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
